- Solid primitives
	- While components are the building blocks of views in Solid apps, primitives are the building blocks of interactivity（在Solid应用中，组件是视图的构建块，而原语是交互性的构建块）
	- primitives
		- signal
		- effect
			- Behind the scenes, Solid's compiler creates effects based on our JSX. It sees that we're using count() in a specific part of the DOM, and it creates an effect that updates just that part of the DOM when the signal reruns.
			- A driving philosophy of Solid is that, by treating everything as a signal or an effect, we can better reason about our application.（Solid的一个驱动理念是，通过将所有事物视为信号或影响，我们可以更好地解释我们的应用程序。）
