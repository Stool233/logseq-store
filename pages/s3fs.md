- Why use an S3 file system
	- Need some degree of POSIX application compatibility（需要一定程度的POSIX应用程序兼容性）
		- Interoperate with both cloud-native and legacy applications
	- Store TBs or PBs of data cheaply with good sequential performance (以较低的成本存储TBs或PBs的数据，具有良好的顺序性能)
		- Archival, analytics, and machine learning
	- Lightweight network file system（轻量级网络文件系统）
		- Personal computer or Raspberry Pi
- Trade-offs -- pick two
	- POSIX、Native Object access、Fast

- FUSE
	- Filesystem in Userspace
	- Allows non-kernel file system implementations（允许非内核文件系统实现）
	- Maps POSIX system calls to FUSE operations
		- ssize_t write(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)
	- Wide variety: btfs, dbxfs, sshfs, and hundreds more
- S3
	- Amazon Simple Storage Service
	- The most popular object storage protocol
	- Object storage offers scale-out performance and lower costs
	- Many implementations: AWS, Backblaze, Ceph, GCS, Minio, and OpenStack Swift
	- Wide variety of applications and SDKs
- Comparing POSIX and S3 APIs
	- POSIX has stateful files while S3 has stateless objects
