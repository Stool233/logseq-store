- Fairness, Weak and Strong
	- There are two kinds of fairness: weak and strong.
		- A weakly fair action will, if it stays enabled, eventually happen.
			- We can declare every label in a process weakly fair by calling it a fair process.

- The Temporal Operators
	- []
		- [] is always.
		- []P means that for P is true for all states in all behaviors.
		- You can also write ~[]P, which means that P will be false for at least one state.
	- <>
		- <> is eventually.
		- <>P means that for every behavior, there is at least one state where P is true.
			- It may be false before, and it may be false after, but what matters is that it was at some point true.
		- You can also write ~<>P, which means that P is never true.
			- Note that this is the same as saying []~P, and in fact <>P is formally defined as ~[]~P.
	- ~>
		- ~> is leads-to. P ~> Q means that if there is some state where P is true, then either Q is true either now or in some future state.
		- Once this is set, it’s irreversible: even if P is later false, Q still must happen.
			- Unlike <>, ~> is “triggered” every time P is true.
		- You can also do P ~> []Q. If P is true, then there is some state where Q becomes true and forever stays true.
	- [ ]<> and <>[ ]
		- []<>P means that P is always eventually true, <>[]P means that P is eventually always true.
			- For a finite spec, these mean the same thing: P is true at termination.
			- For an infinite spec,
				- <>[]P means that there is some point where P becomes true and forever stays true
				- []<>P means that if P ever becomes false, it will eventually become true again.
					- Another way to think about it is that []<>P <=> (~P ~> P): P being false leads to P being true later.
