- The Temporal Operators
	- []
		- [] is always.
		- []P means that for P is true for all states in all behaviors.
		- You can also write ~[]P, which means that P will be false for at least one state.
	- <>
		- <> is eventually.
		- <>P means that for every behavior, there is at least one state where P is true.
			- It may be false before, and it may be false after, but what matters is that it was at some point true.
		- You can also write ~<>P, which means that P is never true.
			- Note that this is the same as saying []~P, and in fact <>P is formally defined as ~[]~P.
