- Fairness, Weak and Strong
	- There are two kinds of fairness: weak and strong.
		- A weakly fair action will, if it stays enabled, eventually happen.
			- We can declare every label in a process weakly fair by calling it a fair process.
		- A strongly fair action, if it’s repeatedly enabled, will eventually happen.
			- There can be gaps in between, but as long as there’s some cycle where it keeps getting enabled again, it will happen.
			- In practice, people don’t often use strong fairness; it’s a much safer to assume the system is only weakly fair.
				- However, it’s worth knowing about for the cases where it is useful.

- The Temporal Operators
	- []
		- [] is always.
		- []P means that for P is true for all states in all behaviors.
		- You can also write ~[]P, which means that P will be false for at least one state.
	- <>
		- <> is eventually.
		- <>P means that for every behavior, there is at least one state where P is true.
			- It may be false before, and it may be false after, but what matters is that it was at some point true.
		- You can also write ~<>P, which means that P is never true.
			- Note that this is the same as saying []~P, and in fact <>P is formally defined as ~[]~P.
	- ~>
		- ~> is leads-to. P ~> Q means that if there is some state where P is true, then either Q is true either now or in some future state.
		- Once this is set, it’s irreversible: even if P is later false, Q still must happen.
			- Unlike <>, ~> is “triggered” every time P is true.
		- You can also do P ~> []Q. If P is true, then there is some state where Q becomes true and forever stays true.
	- [ ]<> and <>[ ]
		- []<>P means that P is always eventually true, <>[]P means that P is eventually always true.
			- For a finite spec, these mean the same thing: P is true at termination.
			- For an infinite spec,
				- <>[]P means that there is some point where P becomes true and forever stays true
				- []<>P means that if P ever becomes false, it will eventually become true again.
					- Another way to think about it is that []<>P <=> (~P ~> P): P being false leads to P being true later.

- [[MapReduce]]
	- 三种不同假设下的形式描述
		-
		  1. A first spec that assumes all workers always succeed.（假设所有的worker都能成功。）
		-
		  id:: 6382c9cc-e87d-447e-96d1-46835002201c
		  2. A second, fault tolerant spec that allows workers to fail.（允许worker出错的容错规范。）
			- The reducer is fair. If it’s not, we can’t guarantee anything happens.
			- There is at least one fair worker. If there’s none, then we can easily see the algorithm couldn’t possible succeed: just have every worker keep crashing and you’ll never meet Liveness.
			- It doesn’t matter which worker is the fair one. This assumption significantly reduces our state space, since we can arbitrarily pick one with CHOOSE.

		  3. A final spec that works even if the recovery mechanism partially fails, too.（即使恢复机制部分失败也能工作）
