	- What is a Proof
		- proposition（命题）
			- A proposition is a statement (communication) that is either true or
			  false.
		- Predicates（谓词）
			- A predicate can be understood as a proposition whose truth depends on the value
			  of one or more variables.
			- Predicate and function
				- This notation for predicates is confusingly similar to ordinary function notation.
				  If P is a predicate, then P(n) is either true or false, depending on the value of n.
				  On the other hand, if p is an ordinary function, like n2+1, then p(n) is a numerical
				  quantity. Don’t confuse these two!
		- The Axiomatic Method ( 公理化方法 )
			- axioms（公理）
				- Propositions like these that are simply accepted as true are called
				  axioms
			- proof（证明）
				- A proof is a sequence of logical deductions from axioms and previously proved statements that concludes with the proposition in question.
				- 证明 是指从公理及已被证明的语句，推导出命题结论的一系列逻辑推理过程。
			- There are several common terms for a proposition that has been proved. The different terms hint at the role of the proposition within a larger body of work
