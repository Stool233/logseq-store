		- sequence
		- discrete
			- Digital system
				- We can abstract its continuous evolution as a sequence of discrete events
					- 我们可以把它的 连续演变 抽象为一系列 离散事件
		- step
			- TLA+ describe a step as a state change
				- 状态变化
				- An execution is represented as a sequence of states
				- A step is the change from one state to the next
