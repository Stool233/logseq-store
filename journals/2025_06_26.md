- Due to these risks to quality, it’s dangerous for organisations to put too much pressure on teams about speed when they roll out AI tools. In their attempt to fulfill those expectations, people will start cutting corners. I believe everyone should waste less energy on measuring ever more seemingly exact numbers about *speed* impact, and instead focus more on monitoring risks and impact on quality. To quote "Cat's Law", recently shared by [Dr. Cat Hicks](https://www.drcathicks.com/) at the Craft conference: "The more a software team fixates on demonstrating short-term performance in their environment, the less they are able to protect the foundation on which long-term performance depends."
