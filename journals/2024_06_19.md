- “翻译界面”产品 与 纯数字产品
	- “In the past couple of decades, we’ve seen a wave of unicorns “digitizing” existing industries, like Uber, Monzo, Revolut, and Amazon. The value they delivered is tangible outside of the digital world: you use them to get to places, to pay in shops, or to order physical goods to your home. For these companies, technology is a “mere” translation interface which enables them to provide their real value.
	  “在过去的几十年里，我们目睹了一波“数字化”现有行业的独角兽企业的出现，比如Uber、Monzo、Revolut和亚马逊。他们所创造的价值在数字世界之外也是显而易见的：你可以用它们来到达目的地、在商店付款，或者在家中订购实物商品。对于这些公司来说，技术仅仅是一个“翻译界面”，使它们能够提供真正的价值。”
	  For purely digital products, all the value is delivered within the product itself. Users will ideally spend hours per day using one product, which is the case with Craft. So much time spent means that both the glitches and the delightful moments massively compound over time. 
	  对于纯数字产品来说，所有的价值都包含在产品本身中。理想情况下，用户每天会花费数小时使用同一款产品，比如Craft。花费如此多的时间意味着，无论是故障还是令人愉悦的时刻，其影响都会随着时间的推移而呈指数级增长。
	  Software quality in purely digital products is not just a meaningful differentiator, but an absolutely necessary one. By definition, when you launch a new product, you will always have more limited functionality than incumbents do. So unless you can offer higher quality, you’ll struggle to get users.”
	  对于纯数字产品来说，软件质量不仅仅是有意义的差异化因素，而且是绝对必要的。按照定义，当你推出一款新产品时，其功能总是比现有产品有限。因此，除非你能提供更高的质量，否则很难吸引用户。

- Software glut means no second chances for low-quality offerings
  软件过剩意味着低质量的产品没有第二次机会。
	- “It's probably past time to retire the philosophy of shipping a software MVP that makes tradeoffs on quality, in order to collect user feedback early.
	  也许到了该摒弃那种为了收集用户反馈而牺牲软件质量的MVP（最小可行产品）理念的时候了。
	  This advice made sense when there wasn't much software out there. But these days there's an explosion of software, and even tools like Google Sheets and Notion enable product workflows without building custom software. And in the age of AI, there's only going to be more software, along with LLMs that avoid the need to even use software.
	  当前市面上的软件还不多时，这条建议还是有道理的。但如今软件市场已经爆炸式增长，像谷歌表格和Notion这样的工具也能实现产品工作流程，无需开发定制软件。在人工智能时代，软件只会越来越多，同时，LLMs（大型语言模型）还能避免使用软件的需要。
	  So anyone building software needs to shift their mindset towards building novel software with craft and taste that is truly differentiated. A simple MVP won't cut it.
	  因此，任何开发软件的人需要转变思维方式，朝着以匠心和品味打造独一无二的创新软件的方向努力。仅仅开发一个简单的最小可行产品（MVP）是不够的。
	  Your competition is no longer non-software solutions. It's probably existing, but suboptimal software. Which means if you're going to compete with it, your software needs to be significantly better.”
	  你的竞争对手不再是非软件解决方案，而是现有但并不完美的软件。这意味着如果你要与之竞争，你的软件必须有显著的改进。
