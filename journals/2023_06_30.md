- ["It's always a tradeoff"](https://bvisness.me/tradeoffs/)
	- Your choices need to be mutually exclusive.
	- It's good to recognize that no solution is perfect. It's good to think about costs and benefits. But don't delude yourself into thinking everything is a tradeoff. That's a cop-out. That's analysis paralysis.
	- Some things are just better than other things. Try to recognize them.
