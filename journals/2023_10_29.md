	- Advice about how to write programs bangs the same drum over and over and over:
		- *Reduce complexity*
		- *Do the simplest thing that could possibly work*
		- *You ain't gonna need it*
		- *Explicit is better than implicit*
	- But here we have someone suggesting the opposite. We should be *extremely* wary.
	- There is always a tradeoff. Leaky abstractions can increase the vertical complexity by more than they decrease the horizontal complexity. Better-designed abstractions can achieve real wins.
	- It’s a hard, hard problem. That’s why they pay us the big bucks.
	- “I felt this was a bad move.
		- Even had the library been a perfect abstraction (it wasn't) and completely bug-free (it wasn't)
		- it would still have had a giant flaw:
			- Every minute of time the students spent learning to use this library was a minute wasted on something that would never be of use and that had no intrinsic value.
			- Every minute of time spent on this library was time that could have been spent learning to use pointers!
		- People programming in C will inevitably have to understand pointers, and will never have to understand this library.”
