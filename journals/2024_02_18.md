- [[eBPF]]对比[[KUtrace]]
	- It is all about speed.  eBPF takes a bytecode program and interprets it to decide what to do and what to trace.  Newer ver- sions have a just-in-time compiler, but that is off by default in Linux.  The JIT has been a source of security exposures.
	  eBPF is useful for tracking less common events or less common packets.  The fact that the “F” means “filter” is the clue—it is not designed to track all packets or, in its extended form (the “e”), to track all of anything else.  eBPF is not designed to track all system calls, interrupts, faults and context switches at full speed in a real-time environment.  KUtrace is designed to do that and essen- tially nothing else, taking about 40 CPU cycles per transition.
	  The other clue is in your use of the word “profile”—a set of counts of how often something happened, with no timeline relating them.  Profiles are useless for understanding variance between execution times of nominally similar tasks, because profiles simply average together all instances.  That is what drove me to design KUtrace.
